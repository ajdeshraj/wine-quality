### Adding Semi-Supervised Learning to an Existing Repo

The training set will be split into 2 parts - labelled and unlabelled

Both sets together will be used in a semi-supervised manner to see if we can improve performance over just the limited labelled set

The labelled data will be supplemented with the unlabelled data. Instead of using the ground truth labels, we will use the predictions of the model as the labels for the "unlabelled" data
